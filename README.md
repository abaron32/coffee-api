# coffee-api

This repo was connected to Heroku. This allows others to use the model to predict if a coffee with determined features is specilaty or not.

Here the app can be seen: https://coffeeapi-ab.herokuapp.com

In order to see the prediction the features have to be added in the route with '/' as separators.
